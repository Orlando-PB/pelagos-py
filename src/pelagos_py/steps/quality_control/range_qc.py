"""Unified range QC test.

Replaces the old ``gross range qc`` (flag values *outside* a good band) and
``impossible range qc`` (flag values *inside* an impossible band) with a single
test that does both. Each range carries an explicit ``inside``/``outside`` keyword
that chooses the behaviour: ``outside`` flags data outside the band (a good band),
``inside`` flags data within it (an impossible band). When no keyword is given the
bound *order* is used as a fallback (ascending ``[low, high]`` -> outside, descending
``[high, low]`` -> inside). A flag may list several ranges so the same flag can cover
more than one band. The test can also propagate a variable's flags onto companion
variables (e.g. flag PRES and TEMP bad whenever CNDC is bad), limit the checks to a
DEPTH window, and plot every flagged variable when diagnostics are enabled.

    Flag measurements by value range. A single, configurable replacement for the
    old separate "gross range" and "impossible range" tests.

    Each ``{flag: bounds}`` entry describes one or more bands. A band is given as a
    ``[low, high]`` pair with an ``inside``/``outside`` keyword saying which side to
    flag:

    - **``[low, high, "outside"]``** — a *good* band; data ``< low`` or ``> high``
      gets the flag. (The old "gross range" behaviour.) Accepts ``outside``, ``out``
      or ``o`` (any capitalisation).
    - **``[low, high, "inside"]``** — an *impossible* band; data strictly between the
      two bounds gets the flag. (The old "impossible range" behaviour.) Accepts
      ``inside``, ``in`` or ``i`` (any capitalisation).
    - **A single scalar** ``value`` — flags exact matches (``data == value``). Handy
      for fill/filler values, e.g. ``4: 0.0`` to flag a pressure of exactly ``0`` as
      bad.

    The same flag can cover several bands by giving a *list of bands*, e.g.
    ``4: [[2, 3, "inside"], [0.1, 10, "outside"]]`` — a point is flagged if it falls in
    *any* of them.

    If the keyword is omitted the bound *order* is used as a fallback: an ascending
    ``[low, high]`` means ``outside`` (a good band) and a descending ``[high, low]``
    means ``inside`` (an impossible band). An explicit keyword always wins over the
    order, so write ``inside``/``outside`` when in doubt.

    Within a variable, entries are applied most-severe-flag-first, so on overlap the
    worse flag wins. Anything checked but not flagged is marked good (1).

    Target Variable: Any
    Flag Number: Any (user-defined)
    Variables Flagged: Any (the tested variables, plus any ``also_flag`` companions)
