"""Capture step diagnostic figures for the PDF report.

Steps draw their diagnostics with matplotlib and display them with
``plt.show()`` when ``diagnostics`` is enabled. To include those plots in the
report regardless of a step's own ``diagnostics`` setting, the pipeline
force-enables diagnostics and runs each step inside :func:`capture_figures`,
which redirects ``plt.show`` so the figures are written to disk instead of being
displayed. The saved paths are then embedded by the report writer.

    Report figures are saved to disk, never displayed, so no GUI backend is
    needed. Steps' diagnostics commonly call ``matplotlib.use("tkagg")`` to
    force the interactive Tk backend; under report capture that is both
    pointless and dangerous - instantiating a Tk canvas off the main thread
    (e.g. when driven from an IDE/GUI) can hard-crash the process on Windows.

    The backend is switched to Agg exactly once here and ``matplotlib.use()`` is
    neutralised for the duration, so every step's backend switch becomes a
    harmless no-op and the backend is never toggled mid-run (repeated
    ``use(..., force=True)`` re-initialises matplotlib's compiled backend, which
    can trigger a fatal delay-load crash on Windows). Both are restored on exit.

    Within the context, every ``plt.show`` call (and any figures still open when

    ``images``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outdir : str
        Directory the figures are written into.
    step_name : str
        Name of the step producing the figures (used to name the files).
    images : list
        List that captured image paths are appended to, in the order produced.
    suppress_text : bool, optional
        When ``True``, stdout is silenced for the duration of the context. Used
        when diagnostics are force-enabled only to capture figures for the
        report: a step whose diagnostics are textual (``print`` rather than a
        plot, e.g. the dataset summary from Load Data) would otherwise dump that
        text to the console even though the user never enabled diagnostics.
    interactive : bool, optional
        When ``False`` (default) figures are saved and closed silently - no
        window is shown. This is used for steps whose diagnostics were
        force-enabled only to harvest figures for the report, and keeps the run
        headless (Agg) and Windows-safe.

        When ``True`` (the user explicitly set ``diagnostics: true`` on this
        step) the figure is saved to the report *and* shown in a blocking popup,
        so the pipeline pauses on that step exactly as it would outside a report
        run. This temporarily switches to the interactive Tk backend for the
        duration of the step and switches back to headless Agg afterwards; the
        GUI backend is the reason this path is opt-in only.
