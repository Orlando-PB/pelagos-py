Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
Unfortunately, this software is not yet available as an installable package. We hope to change this soon. If you would like to use in now however, you are welcome to clone/copy the 
repository onto your own device. The requirements for the toolbox can be installed using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

If using Anaconda, the ``environment.yaml`` file can be used to create a conda environment using:

``conda env create -f environment.yaml``.

This should include all of the packages required to operate the software and run the example notebooks.

Example Pipeline
----------------
If you are new here, we recommend that you check out the ``example/notebooks/pipeline_demo.ipynb`` jupyter notebook. This presents an example use case of processing CTD measurements from freely 
available glider data hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC). A fully commented config file is also used for this processing, so make sure you check it out!

The details of how each step works can be found in the documentation (see below). This is currently a work in progress so some steps may be missing or badly formatted. If you spot any mistakes 
or would like a specific steps documentation to be prioritized, please leave an issue in the `github issues page <https://github.com/NOC-OBG-Autonomy/toolbox/issues>`_.
